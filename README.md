This is a toy compiler written using ```flex```, ```bison``` and ```C``` for our custom defined language ```HHPS```.

## About the Language

```HHPS``` is a language mainly based on ```C``` and ```Python``` and attempts to bring the best of both worlds together.

It is a very beginner friendly language with simple and intuitive syntax and grammar.

> Basic structure of a program in ```HHPS```:

```
** Function Declaration Block**
If there are any functions to be declared in the program, they should be declared here.
If none, this block can be skipped.
```
```
** Main Function **
This is the main function similar to C.
The main function is the first code that is executed when the operating system runs the program.
```
